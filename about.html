      <p>I founded Publicus to improve the way research is  done.</p> 

      <p>Research has the potential to provide incredible advancements and improvements to our society. While it sometimes lives up to this potential, it is often hindered by the complicated realities of funding, publishing, and politics.</p>

      <p>Researchers are under constant pressure to produce sensational results in order to get into selective journals that will make them look more appealing to funders. In this &lsquo;publish or perish&rsquo; world, some important research never sees the light of day because it is deemed too boring. Other research makes headlines, only to be retracted later because it can&rsquo;t be reproduced. These examples are symptoms of a system of bad incentives in research.</p>

      <p>At its core, Publicus is an attempt to realign these incentives, to allow research to be evaluated based on its own merit by a community of peers.</p>

      <p>I have always been looking for a way to make a positive impact on our society. I stopped looking when I founded Publicus.</p>
