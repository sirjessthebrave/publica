    <h2>Publicusâ€™ mission is to improve the way research is done.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>Research is the cornerstone of progress in our society. At its best, it fulfills our drive to understand more about the universe we live in and our role in it. Through research, we can explore the cosmos, unravel the mysteries of genes and disease, and more fully understand our relationships with one another.

    <p>Although research produces great advancements, it still relies on ineffective relics of the 1700s that limit us in our search for truth. Publicus aims to obliterate those limits.</p>

    <p>Publicus is an open platform for scholars to share and collectively evaluate their work. Instead of waiting years for a journal to tell them if their research is worthy to be printed, Publicus will allow researchers to instantly share and immediately get feedback on their work from a community of peers. With Publicus, research will be evaluated based on its own merits, not its affiliations.</p>
