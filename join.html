    <h2>Research for the 21st century</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>Researchers are under constant pressure to produce sensational results, get into selective journals, and look more appealing to funders. In this &lsquo;publish or perish&rsquo; world, some important research never sees the light of day because it isn&rsquo;t flashy. Other research makes headlines, only to be retracted later because it can&rsquo;t be reproduced. These are symptoms of bad incentives in research.</p>

    <!-- <p><a href="about.html"><h3>About Us</h3></a></p> -->

    <p>Publicus will realign these incentives to allow research to be evaluated based on its own merit by a community of peers. Think tripadvisor for research papers.</p>

    <p>We are currently looking for a technical architect to help build the infrastructure for our platform.  Send us an email telling us why you want to join us, how you&rsquo;d like to contribute, and why you&rsquo;re qualified.</p>


    <p>If you&rsquo;re not a technical  architect, worry not! As we get going there will be many other opportunities to contribute. If you are passionate about making a positive difference, we still want to hear from you. </p>
